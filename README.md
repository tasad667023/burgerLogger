## Assignment 11 :Burger Logger
This assignment is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. When a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Eat this burger" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will also store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
